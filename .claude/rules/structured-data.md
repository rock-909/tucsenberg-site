# Structured Data / JSON-LD Rules

All schema objects are built through `src/lib/structured-data-generators.ts`.

Pages and component shells may render `<JsonLdScript>` or `<JsonLdGraphScript>`,
but they must not hand-roll schema objects inline.

## Rendering and escaping

Render JSON-LD through the shared SEO script components. Do not use page-local
`JSON.stringify` inside inline scripts.

If a new JSON-LD script shape is needed, add it to the shared renderer and keep
escaping behavior covered by tests.

## Injection points

- Shared graph: `JsonLdGraphScript` merges stable `#organization` and `#website`
  identity nodes with page-specific schemas on pages that render structured data.
- Page: page-specific schemas such as FAQPage, Article, Product, WebPage,
  ItemList, and BreadcrumbList.
- Component shell: only when the shell owns page-level rendering, and the
  schema still comes from the shared generators.

## FAQ schema

FAQ content comes from page-owned MDX frontmatter whenever the page has an MDX
source.

Use `generateFaqSchemaFromItems()` from `src/lib/content/mdx-faq.ts`.

Do not add another FAQ helper for the same item shape.

## Public page schema coverage

When changing public page schema output, keep focused tests for the expected
schema types.

Product detail pages that represent one catalog item should emit a single
`Product` node plus supporting graph nodes such as `BreadcrumbList` and
`FAQPage` when those concepts apply.
