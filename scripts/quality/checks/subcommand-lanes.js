/**
 * Reconciles every `scripts/starter-checks.js` subcommand against the lanes
 * that invoke it.
 *
 * A check nobody runs is identical to a check that does not exist, except that
 * it reads as coverage. `markdown-fences` sat like that for months and was only
 * found by grepping all twenty subcommands by hand.
 *
 * WHAT THIS PROVES, EXACTLY: the subcommand appears in command position inside
 * a structurally identified lane — a workflow step's `run:`, a lefthook
 * command's `run:`, or a release-proof-manifest step. It does not observe
 * runtime execution, so a step guarded by a real `if:` condition still counts
 * as a lane; only a literally-false condition is rejected.
 *
 * Three rounds of adversarial review turned earlier versions green without
 * wiring a lane: a YAML key named `run` under `env:`, `echo "node
 * scripts/starter-checks.js foo"`, a heredoc body, a `;` inside quotes, a quote
 * spanning two lines, `\"`, a redirection target. The lesson was that patching
 * one character at a time loses. Tokenizing now follows the shell's own rules
 * in `shell-command-scan.js`; this file only decides what a parsed command
 * invokes. What that leaves:
 *
 * - Only `jobs.*.steps[].run` and lefthook `<hook>.commands.*.run` are read.
 *   A key named `run` sitting in `env:` or `with:` is not a command.
 * - A command counts only when the executor is in command position. `echo
 *   "node scripts/starter-checks.js x"` starts with `echo`, so it is text.
 * - Manual runbook lanes are reported in their own bucket. A human being told
 *   to type a command is a lane, but it is not an automated one, and the two
 *   must not be printed as the same thing.
 * - `pnpm run x` runs package script `x`; `pnpm exec x` / `npx x` run a binary
 *   named `x`. Conflating them invents lanes that do not exist.
 *
 * WHERE IT REFUSES TO GUESS. Three shapes are reported and fail the check
 * rather than returning "no lane here": a command substitution that names this
 * script, an executor that comes from a variable, and a flag on a `node` or
 * package-runner command. A silent empty answer is wrong in both directions —
 * it drops a real lane, and it also hides the case where the command names a
 * subcommand that is not registered at all. Nothing in this repo spells a lane
 * any of those ways, so the cost of demanding a plain spelling is zero today.
 *
 * WHAT IT STILL DOES NOT SEE, stated rather than papered over: reachability.
 * This reads command position. A command after a top-level `exit 0`, or inside
 * a shell branch that never runs, still counts as a lane. Closing that needs a
 * shell interpreter, and the cheap approximations are worse than the hole —
 * real steps here use `exit 1` inside `if` blocks, so "stop at the first exit"
 * would silently drop live lanes instead. `xargs` and multiplexers like
 * `concurrently "node a" "node b"` are missed the other way: the call is not
 * seen, and the subcommand is reported as an orphan.
