Each ABS unit locks into the next; the approaching water presses the L-shaped base down and seals it against the ground. Heights from 50 to 85 cm, with straight, curved and gable-end units so the wall actually closes around real sites. We supply dealers, contractors and businesses factory-direct, from a single carton to full containers.",
