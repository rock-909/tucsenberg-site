  lead: "Measure once, install the fixings once; from then on the opening seals in minutes, every season, with planks that stack between posts and store flat the rest of the year. We supply the planks, posts, seals and spares factory-direct, custom-cut to your opening schedule. Depending on your market you may know this category as flood boards (UK), removable flood panels or garage flood barriers — same system, same parts.",
  leadNote:
    "One boundary before anything else: a flood gate protects a defined opening. It earns its money when the door or garage really is where the water comes in — not when water rises through the slab, the soil or the drains, and not when the wall around the opening is itself porous. And rain can still fall or blow in behind any barrier, so plan for a pump or a drain on the protected side. Unsure which case is yours? Send site photos with your RFQ and we'll tell you which.",
